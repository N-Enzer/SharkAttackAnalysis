# Shark Attack Analysis

The Global Shark Attack File provides details on every recorded shark attack in the human history. All of the data was taken from the GSAF via a Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks).

The goal with this project was to practice data analysis with Python and to learn more about shark attacks. Both goals were accomplished.

All code was written by me (N-Enzer).
