# SharkAttackAnalysis

# The Global Shark Attack File provides details on every recorded shark attack in the world. 
# I found this dataset (csv) on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks).
# My goal was to work with this data to learn more about shark attacks, and to practice data analysis with Python using pandas and matplotlib.
