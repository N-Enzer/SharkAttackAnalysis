# Shark Attack Data Analysis

The Global Shark Attack File provides details on every recorded shark attack in the human history. All of the data was taken from the GSAF via a Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks).

The goal with this project was to practice data analysis with Python and to learn more about shark attacks. Both goals were accomplished.

"Shark Attacks.ipynb" contains the code and "attacks.csv" contains the dataset.

All code was written by me (N-Enzer).
