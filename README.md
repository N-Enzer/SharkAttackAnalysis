# Shark Attack Analysis

The Global Shark Attack File provides details on every recorded shark attack in the history of the world. All of the data was taken from the GSAF via a Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks).

My goal was to work with this dataset to practice data analysis with Python using pandas and matplotlib and to learn more about shark attacks.

All code was written by me (N-Enzer).
